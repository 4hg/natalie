Natalie is a work-in-progress, compiled, object-oriented language resembling Ruby.

It provies an ahead-of-time compiler using C and gcc/clang as the backend. Also, the language has a REPL that performs incremental compilation.

There is much work left to do before this is useful. Please let me know if you want to help!
